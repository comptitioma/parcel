## What can JMatProÂ® do?
  
JMatProÂ® can perform various calculations for different types of alloys, such as steels, nickel, aluminum, titanium, magnesium, cobalt, zirconium, copper alloys and tin-based solder[^2^]. Some of the calculations that JMatProÂ® can do are:
  
- Stable and metastable phase equilibria based on thermodynamics/Calphad
- Solidification simulation (Scheil, back diffusion)
- Phase transformation and precipitation diagrams (TTT, CCT, TTP)
- Physical properties, such as thermal expansion, heat capacity, density, etc.
- Mechanical properties, such as strength, flow curves, creep, etc.
- Chemical properties, such as diffusion coefficients, activity coefficients, etc.
- Export of material cards to various CAE systems

JMatProÂ® has an easy to use graphical user interface and is also liked by occasional users. Even for complex alloys it delivers tangible results in a short time[^2^]. JMatProÂ® is also validated by extensive experimental data and literature references[^1^].
  
## How to use JMatProÂ®?
  
To use JMatProÂ®, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install JMatProÂ® from the official website or from your distributor. You can also request a free demo version that offers a large number of calculated examples for different alloy systems[^3^].
2. Launch JMatProÂ® and select the alloy system that you want to work with. You can choose from the predefined alloy systems or create your own custom alloy system.
3. Enter the composition of your alloy in weight percent or atomic percent. You can also import compositions from a file or from a database.
4. Select the calculation type that you want to perform. You can choose from the available calculation types per material type or create your own custom calculation type.
5. Specify the calculation parameters, such as temperature range, step size, cooling rate, etc. You can also modify the default thermodynamic and kinetic data if needed.
6. Run the calculation and wait for the results. You can view the results in graphical or tabular form. You can also export the results to a file or to a CAE system.

JMatProÂ® also offers an extensive online help facility that provides detailed information on how to use the software and how to interpret the results[^1^]. You can also contact the support team or attend training courses if you need further assistance.
  
## Why use JMatProÂ®?
  
JMatProÂ® is a unique and powerful tool that can help you with various aspects of alloy design and optimization. By using JMatProÂ®, you can:

- Understand the phase behavior and properties of your alloys at different temperatures and conditions
- Predict the effects of alloying elements and processing parameters on your alloys
- Optimize your alloys for specific applications and performance criteria
- Generate accurate and consistent material data for your CAE simulations
- Save time and money by reducing experimental trials and errors

JMatProÂ® is widely used by many companies around the world and is also increasingly used in education and research[^2^]. It is a reliable and user-friendly software that can help you achieve your alloy development goals.
