In this article, we will show you how to dual log-in in Dragon Nest private server using a simple method that does not require any third-party software or complicated settings. This method works for most private servers, but it may not work for some servers that have anti-dual log-in measures. Please use this method at your own risk and respect the rules of the server you are playing on.
 
## Step 1: Create a copy of your Dragon Nest folder
 
The first step is to create a copy of your Dragon Nest folder, which contains all the game files and data. You can find your Dragon Nest folder in the location where you installed the game, usually in C:\Program Files (x86)\Dragon Nest or C:\Program Files\Dragon Nest. To create a copy, simply right-click on the folder and select Copy, then paste it in another location, such as your desktop or another drive. You can rename the copied folder to something like Dragon Nest 2 or Dragon Nest Multi.
 
## Step 2: Run both Dragon Nest clients
 
The next step is to run both Dragon Nest clients from the original and the copied folders. To do this, simply double-click on the launcher.exe file in each folder and wait for the game to load. You may need to enter your account information and select the server you want to play on. You should be able to see two Dragon Nest windows on your screen, one for each client.
 
## Step 3: Log in with different accounts or characters
 
The final step is to log in with different accounts or characters on each client. To do this, simply enter your username and password on each client and select the character you want to play with. You can use the same account on both clients, but you need to use different characters. For example, you can use your main character on one client and your alt character on another client. You can also use different accounts on each client if you have more than one account.
 
Once you are logged in, you can play with both characters at the same time. You can switch between the clients by using Alt+Tab or clicking on the window you want to focus on. You can also resize or move the windows to fit your screen better. You can use this method to dual log-in as many times as you want, as long as your computer can handle it.
 
## Conclusion
 
Dual log-in in Dragon Nest private server is a fun and useful way to play with more than one character at the same time. It can help you level up faster, trade items or enjoy different classes. However, it may not work for some servers that have anti-dual log-in measures or ban players who use this method.
