However, finding your activation code can be tricky, especially if you have lost your original email or receipt that contains the information. In this article, we will show you some ways to find your Justkaraoke 20 activation code and enjoy your karaoke sessions.
 
## Check Your Email
 
The first and easiest way to find your activation code is to check your email. When you buy Justkaraoke 20 online, you will receive an email from Tricerasoft, the company that developed the software. The email will have your order number, invoice number, and activation code. You can use this code to activate your software by entering it in the registration window that pops up when you launch Justkaraoke 20.
 
If you can't find the email in your inbox, try searching for "Tricerasoft" or "Justkaraoke" in your email server. You may also want to check your spam or junk folder, as sometimes the email may end up there. If you still can't find the email, you can contact Tricerasoft's customer support at support@tricerasoft.com and provide them with your order number or invoice number. They may be able to resend you the email with your activation code.
 
## Check Your Backup Files
 
Another way to find your activation code is to check your backup files. If you have backed up your computer or saved your files on a disc or flash drive, you may be able to find your activation code there. For example, if you have saved the email that contains your activation code on your computer, you can look for it in your backup files. Alternatively, if you have created a file that contains your activation code and other important information about your software purchase, you can look for it in your backup files as well.
 
To access your backup files, you will need to connect your disc or flash drive to your computer and open it. Then, you can search for "Tricerasoft" or "Justkaraoke" in your backup files and see if you can find the file that contains your activation code. You can then copy and paste the code into the registration window of Justkaraoke 20.
 
## Check Your Registry
 
The last way to find your activation code is to check your registry. The registry is a database that stores information about your system and software settings. Sometimes, when you install Justkaraoke 20 on your computer, it may store your activation code in the registry. However, this method is not recommended for beginners or inexperienced users, as editing the registry can be risky and may cause damage to your system if done incorrectly.
 
To check your registry, you will need to open the Registry Editor on your computer. You can do this by pressing Windows + R keys on your keyboard and typing "regedit" in the Run box. Then, click OK or press Enter. This will open the Registry Editor window. In the Registry Editor window, you can navigate to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Tricerasoft\JustKaraoke 2\. There, you may see a value named "Activation Code" or something similar. You can double-click on this value and see if it shows your activation code. You can then copy and paste the code into the registration window of Justkaraoke 20.
 
## Conclusion
 
Finding your Justkaraoke 20 activation code can be challenging if you have lost or misplaced it. However, there are some ways to find it and activate your software. You can check your email, check your backup files, or check your registry for your activation code. However, if none of these methods work for you, you may want to consider switching to a different karaoke hosting software that has more features and better support than Tricerasoft's Justkaraoke 20.
