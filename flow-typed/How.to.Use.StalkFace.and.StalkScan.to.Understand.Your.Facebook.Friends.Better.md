If you want to find out more about your Facebook friends, you can use two web apps that can help you access their public information in a systematic and classified manner. These apps are StalkFace and StalkScan. They are not meant for stalking anyone on Facebook, but for gathering and organizing data of your friends who have already connected with you on Facebook.
  
## What is StalkFace?
  
StalkFace is a web app that allows you to stalk someone on Facebook by entering their personal profile URL. It does not violate Facebook's privacy settings, as it only shows hidden content that you have access to. However, you need to make sure that your Facebook is configured in English (US) for it to work properly.
  
StalkFace can help you find out various information about your Facebook friend, such as:
  
- Their profile photos, stories, videos, groups, events, games, apps, and tags.
- The photos they have liked, commented on, or been tagged in.
- The stories they have written, liked, or commented on.
- The pages, political parties, religion, music, movies, books, places, stores, outdoors, hotels, theaters they have liked or been interested in.
- The places they have visited or checked in.

You can also filter the results by time period (this week, this month, this year) or by category (everything, photos, stories, videos).
  
## What is StalkScan?
  
StalkScan is another web app that allows you to scan any Facebook profile for public information. It also does not violate Facebook's privacy settings, as it only shows what is already accessible by anyone on the internet. However, unlike StalkFace, it does not require you to have your Facebook in English (US).
  
StalkScan can help you find out more details about your Facebook friend's profile than StalkFace. For example:

- Their basic info (gender, age range, relationship status), contact info (email address), education info (school), work info (employer), life events (birthdays), and personal quotes.
- Their friends list (including mutual friends), family members (including siblings), followers list (including celebrities), and blocked users list.
- Their posts (including hidden posts), comments (including deleted comments), likes (including reactions), shares (including reshares), mentions (including tags), and reviews (including ratings).
- Their photos (including albums), videos (including live videos), stories (including archived stories), events (including past events), groups (including joined groups), pages (including liked pages), interests (including music and movies), and places (including nearby places).

You can also filter the results by date range or by keyword.
